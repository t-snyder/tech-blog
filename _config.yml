  The purpose of the prototype project is to demonstrate the configuration and use of 
  ingress-nginx, and then increasing complexity with Cert-Manager and Pekko-Http within 
  the minikube environment. The tests include http and https terminated at the ingress 
  controller. Cert-manager is used to manage self-signed certificates for the TLS.
