I am current working on developing a core functionality for a Vertx based micro-service which uses Pulsar messaging as its transport and Cassandra for Event Source Data.
Connectivity both to the micro-service and between components is TLS encrypted so the Kube Gateway API, Istio Ambient Mode and Cert-Manager are also included.
