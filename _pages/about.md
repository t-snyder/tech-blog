# At the Beach - A Tech Blog

This is just another humble tech blog that I use to document my various explorations
now that I find I have time to actually dive into things. So these
prototypes are generated between time spent swimming, sunbathing, sitting at the beach,
drinking a beer, watching pretty girls walk by in bikinis, etc. 

The general theme surrounding this blog is security. I have been fortunate enough to
be able to live multiple years in various parts of the world, including approximately
10 years in Central and South America and various places in Sub Sahara Africa. One of
the first things you learn coming from the US or Europe is the importance of securing
your home. 

In South America (Equador, Colombia) I learned about multi level security. The first
level is the wall surrounding the compound and the gate. The wall should be high enough
to prevent opportunistic access (thieves), sometimes with broken glass, or barbed wire at
the top. After the compound wall, there are multiple options depending upon the threat
level. At a minimum there will be metal grates on all windows and doors, with the door
grates locking with sturdy padlocks. After this are the sturdy doors which also lock.

Depending upon threat levels a compound might also have dogs and in some cases security
personnel on the grounds. Many houses have silent alarms that when pressed prompt security
company personnel to converge on the property.

In conclusion, for middle class homes and above there is at least 3 levels of security
surrounding the property. Generally there are more. I bring this up as it is the same way
I approach security within app deployments. Security must be multi level and designed in 
from the start.

As mentioned above the theme of this blog is roughly security. But not is a unifying
way. The prototypes included here are for the most part isolated components with potential 
security implications. 

In closing - Blogs which start with Deploy have a deployable prototype behind them. Blogs
which start with Thoughts are pontifications on some subject of current interest.
